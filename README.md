DEVCON PHILOSOPHY 

1. We believe knowledge can be free. Knowledge can be free with the right model. Every knowledge that we teach to a new person, that person is obligated to teach that knowledge to the other new person. Ones can only complete the learning after ones teach it to others.
2. We let people focus on their strength. We let others cover their weakness.
